# About

I am currently working in **AMD GPU Graphics** team as **Sr. Silicon Design Engineer**. \
Prior to that I was a grad student at the SoC lab in  the University of British Columbia, working with Professor [Mieszko Lis](http://mieszko.ece.ubc.ca/) and Professor [Lutz Lampe](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~lampe/). \
My research mainly focused on:  
1) Hadware accelerators for 5G systems.  
2) Hadware accelerators for Machine Learning workloads.
